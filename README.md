# Get to know me

### Ana Catarina Basílio, but just **Catarina** is fine! 

Hey! I'm Catarina, 29 years old and live in the *sunny rectangle of Europe* - Portugal. I'm originally from Alentejo (Estremoz), but I now live in Cascais. 

A few things you should know about me: 
1. I'm an Archaeologist (and no, we do not dig dinosaurs);
2. The coolest thing I found was a 4 thousand years old copper dagger inside a vessel;  
3. I'm doing my PhD (and going crazy due to it, that is why I want to change areas); 
4. I have 3 tattoos (one of them is of an archaeological vessel - archaeology nerd much!); 
5. I have two ferrets and a dog; 
6. I practice kickboxing, 
7. I have more than 35 published papers and a published book; 
7. I speak 3 languages, fluently (Portuguese, Spanish and English). 

Enough about this. What about if I tell you about my favourite film series? Should I add a quote (it is not specifically from my favourite film, but you'll get there)? 

 >*Lily! After all this time?* he asked and ***Always*** he replied.  

Do you want to guess? 

- [x] Harry Potter and the half-blood prince, OBVIOUSLY!

Coding has been a good experience, so far. I've learned so much with the CFG Course. I have experience with R and data analysis since I've had a few specific courses for using *R in Archaeology*. However, I'll tell you my secret: I'm kinda in love with Python and SQL (Don't judge me!). 

Here is a table of my general feedback/review of some of the topics we covered in the course: 

| Topics     | Overall (out of 5)| Why?     |
| :---       |    :----:   |          ---: |
| JS/CSS/HTML      |  4.5      | Enjoyed creating an aesthetic  |
| Python   | 5        | Simple syntax and a lot of potential     |
| SQL  | 5        | It can get so complex (something I like)     |
| GIT | 3       | Huge mess at the beginning, but getting there    |


I'll stop now! I'm really glad to meet you all! Feel free to contact me using my email <catarinasbasilio@gmail.com>.
